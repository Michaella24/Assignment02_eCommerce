# Assignment02_eCommerce
Assignment 02 done by Michaella Nsumanyi and Damiano Miloncini

# First Push
Main structure of application created (directories, files & database)
Adjust the database if needed
Began publications view/model/controller
Didnt do the App.php in core yet because i want to study it while i do it later 

# Second Push
-App.php is partially complete (the filtering is missing bc i want to study it later)
-User register view is done (only CSS missing but I'm keeping all the styling for the very end)
-User register() method in the controller done !


# Breakdown of my understanding of the assignment
Everyone has to be a user to access the application.
Only a user with a profile account can add a comment, update a comment, delete a comment, 
manage their content and edit their profile information 
A user with a profile as well as a simple user(person) can read and search comments.


# Third push
-App.php is complete
-Filtering is complete and functional
-Profile view for create,update, and delete complete. (The home page should be the publication view)
-User view for create, register complete (delete method complete but not sure if we should have a delete page for the user ?)
-Profile controller for create,update,and delete complete. (The profilePage method should follow your logic for the publication view)
-User controller for create,update and logout complete.
-Profile model with the CRUD is done.
-User model with the CRUD is done.
I can't believe i'm done with this part I will cry (happy tears ofc)

# Seventh Push
